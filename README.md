MvcCore Router extension to manage your website media version in url
to have media flag in request, controller and view to render different
templates, css and js files for mobiles, tables or desktops.

## Installation
```shell
composer require mvccore/ext-router-media
```

## Features
- **Routing**
	- Router recognizes user device as three predefined versions - `full`, `tablet` or `mobile` - in first request by HTTP header `User-Agent` with third party [`\Mobile_Detect`](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) library.
	- Router stores recognized device version string in it's own session namespace with configurable expiration (to not process `\Mobile_Detect` recognition in every request again).
	- Router completes `$request->GetMediaSiteVersion()` value to use it anywhere in your app as strings: `full`, `tablet` or `mobile`.
	- Router replaces possibly founded media prefix substring in request path (`$request->GetPath()`) with empty string. It keeps request path everytime in the same form to process routing as usual.
	- Strict mode media site version configuration option to drive application media version strictly by session value.
- **Url generating**
	- Router completes every application url (or every `GET` url by configuration) generated by build-in `Url()` method with media 		  prefix substring by requested media version or media version given as second argument array with url params for `Url()` method.
	- There is also possible to configure the url media version substring prefix.

## How it works
- Routing
	- Router completes media site versions from these sources:
		- From requested url (if there is no media site prefix in url, it's completed to `full`).
		- From session (if there is nothing, it stays on `NULL`).
		- From special `$_GET` param to switch media site version in session strict mode (also could be `NULL`).
	- Router process pre route redirections by source data if necessary:
		- If there is allowed value in special `$_GET` switching param:
		  	- New media site version is stored in session and request is 
		  	  redirected to new media site version by special switching param.
		- Else if there is no media site version in session from any previous request:
		  	- There is recognized media site version by third party library
		  	  [`\Mobile_Detect`](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect)
		  	  and stored in session for next requests.
			- There is also completed flag, if detected version is the same as requested version.
		- If strict session mode is configured to `FALSE` (by default):
			- If request is first (nothing is in session from previous requests):
			  	- If detected version is different than request version:
					- Redirect user to detected version:
				- Else route request with requested media site version in standard way 
				  later, do not process any redirections.
			- Else route request with requested media site version in standard way 
			  later, do not process any redirections.
		- If strict session mode is configured to `TRUE`:
			- If requested media site version is different than session version:
			  	- Redirect user to session version.
			- Else route request with requested media site version in standard way 
			  later, do not process any redirections.
	- Router removes any founded media site version url prefix to process
	  routing for any media site version with the same request path.
	- Than router routes request in standard way.
- Url completing
	- Router generates url adresses always with the same media site version
	  as requested media site version version:
	  	- For addresses without any defined rewrite route, there is added into query 
	      string additional param about media site version (`&media_version=...`).
		- For addresses with defined rewrite route, there is prepended media site 
		  version url prefix by ruter configuration.
	- If requested version is `full` (`full` is by default), there is not necessary
	  to put into url addresses any additional data, so for `full` version, there 
	  is always the same original url string without any special params or prefixes.
	- If you define info build-in `Url()` method into second argument array into
	  params any different media site version than requested media version is,
	  there is added into result url string query param or media site url prefix 
	  by given media site version.
	- if there is configured session strict mode, special `$_GET` switching param
	  is always added automaticly.

## Usage
Add this to `/App/Bootstrap.php` or to **very application beginning**, 
before application routing or any other extension configuration
using router for any purposes:
```php
$app = & \MvcCore\Application::GetInstance();
$app->SetRouterClass('\MvcCore\Ext\Routers\Media');
...
/** @var $router \MvcCore\Ext\Routers\Media */
$router = & \MvcCore\Router::GetInstance();
```

## Configuration

### Session expiration
There is possible to change session expiration about detected media
site version value to not recognize media site version every request
where is no prefix in url, because to process all regular expressions 
in `\Mobile_Detect` library could take some time. By **default** there is **1 hour**. 
You can change it by:
```php
$router->SetSessionExpirationSeconds(
	\MvcCore\Session::EXPIRATION_SECONDS_DAY
);
```

### Media url prefixes and allowed media versions
To allow only selected media site versions and to configure url prefixes, you can use:
```php
// to allow only mobile version (with url prefix '/mobile') 
// and full version (with no url prefix):
use \MvcCore\Ext\Routers;
...
// now, tablet version is not allowed:
$router->SetAllowedSiteKeysAndUrlPrefixes([
	Routers\Media::MEDIA_VERSION_MOBILE	=> '/mobile',
	// if you are using an empty string url prefix for full version, 
	// you need to define it as the last item!
	Routers\Media::MEDIA_VERSION_FULL	=> '',
]);
```

### Strict session mode
Stric session mode is router mode, when media site version is managed
by session value from the first request recognition. 

Normally, there is possible to get different media site version only by 
requesting different media site version url prefix. For example - to get 
different version from `full` version, for example to get `mobile` version, 
it's only necessary to request application with configured `mobile` prefix 
in url like this: `/mobile/any/application/request/path`.

**But in session strict mode, there is not possible to change media site 
version only by requesting different media site version prefix in url.**
All requests to different media site version then version in session are 
automaticly redirected to media site version stored in session.

In session strict mode, there is possible to change media site version only 
by special `$_GET` parametter in your media version navigation. For example - 
to get different version from `full` version, for eample `mobile` version, 
you need to add into query string parametter like this:
`/any/application/request/path?switch_media_version=mobile`
Then, there is changed media site version stored in session and user is 
redirected to mobile application version with mobile url prefixes everywhere.

To have this session strict mode, you only need to configure router by:
```php
$router->SetStricModeBySession(TRUE);
```

### Routing `GET` requests only
Router manages media site version only for `GET` requests. It means
redirections to proper version in session stric mode or to redirect
in first request to recognized media site version. `POST` requests
and other request methods to manage for media site version doesn't 
make sence. For those requests, you have still media site version 
record in session and you can use it any time. But to process all
request methods, you can configure router to do so like this:
```php
$router->SetRouteGetRequestsOnly(FALSE);
```
